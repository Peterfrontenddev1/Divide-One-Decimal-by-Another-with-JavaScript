                                                QUESTION

                                                const quotient = 0.0 / 2.0; // Change this line
                                                Change the 0.0 so that quotient will equal to 2.2.
                                                The variable quotient should equal 2.2
                                                You should use the / operator to divide 4.4 by 2
                                                The quotient variable should only be assigned once
                                                
                                                ANSWER
                                                
                                                const quotient = 4.4 / 2.2;
